Note: The 'less' utility, for whatever reason, needs its
configuration files to be compiled with the 'lesskey'
program. The 'lesskey' program will compile '~/.lesskey'
into '~/.less'.

As such, you will have to manually  convert the LESS file in
this directory into a compiled '~/.less' file. This file is
the only permitted user-specific less configuration file. 

As less doesn't support alternate configuration file
locations, you can then copy the generated '~/.less' file
into '/etc/sysless'
